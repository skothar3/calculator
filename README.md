# calculator

Here is an interactive calculator I built using html, css and javascript. The calculation logic was wired by manipulating strings through regular expressions (something I wanted to experiment with).

Features include:

- Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- Advanced arithmetic (Square roots, exponents, percentages, plus/minus, and decimals)
- Keyboard interactivity
